how to run:

1.make

2.open another terminal(you need one terminal for server and aother one for each client)

3.run server by with command ./server

4.run client with command ./client 127.0.0.1

5.you can send PUSH,TOP,POP from the client terminal

## Remarks:

* PUSH and POP you see in server terminal.(for my debugging).

* TOP you see in the client terminal.

* the sleep in func push is just for the first time(it's for the test), do not delete that.
